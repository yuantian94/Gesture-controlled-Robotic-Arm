# Gesture-controlled-Robotic-Arm
The project focuses on designing and building a robotic arm that mimics human arm movements. It comprises Control, Software, Communications, and Hand/Myo Subsystems. Kinect technology sends arm movement signals to the mechanical arm. This robot improves user interface for people in dangerous situations, capturing human perspective and interactions.
